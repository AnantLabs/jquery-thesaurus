You can apply the plugin for content areas on your site pages and it will highlight all the terms from the dictionary (by default: sample.csv). When hovering a term, visitors of your site will get definition of the term on a tooltip. Content of the appeared tooltip is being processed as well. So if any terms are encountered , they get definition-tooltips attached. If you switch to DB data-source, you will have visits and click statistics collected.

You can use this plugin to create intelligent advertisement, tooltip to show portal news description, interactive reference book and so on and so forth.

FEATURES

  * Support of Unicode for terms and descriptions (проверка).
  * Retrieving data though Cross-Domain Request. That allows you to have the same controller for instaces of Thesaurus on different domains.
  * Nesting of tooltips. When the term occures within the tooltip text it will cause another tooltip when hovering by mouse.
  * Manual effects, based on CSS3 transition can be easily applied.
  * Optional: Toolbar view and click (within toolbar overlay) statistics are collected and pushed to the server with specified time intervals in a queue.
